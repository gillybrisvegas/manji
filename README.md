# Manji Consulting Services
## SAP Plant Maintenance • Enterprise Asset Management • Project Management

Manji is a consultancy that helps our clients achieve more from their SAP investment. 
We specialise in SAP Enterprise Asset Management. 
If you are preparing to implement or currently use SAP Plant Maintenance, Project Systems or Materials Management, then we can help. We can project manage implementations or supplement your existing team with expert knowledge to fast track your projects.

### Recent Projects
**Enhancement Package Implementation**
SAP Enhancement Packages have provided new opportunities to streamline your business processes. We helped our client assess and implement new functionality from the SAP Enhancement Packages.

**Work Order and Warehouse Integration**
Maintenance supervisors need to know if parts are on-site before commencing the job.  We improved warehouse business processes and enhanced SAP functionality. This provided visibility of material availability to the maintenance supervisors.

**Support Package Project Management**
SAP Support Packages are typically applied annually to ensure legal compliance and resolve SAP system defects.  We provided project management assistance to implement support packages into a SAP landscape containing ECC, BW, Portal, CRM and PI systems.

**Archiving Plant Maintenance Data**
Our client required plant maintenance data to be archived.  We worked with the client team to perform SAP archiving and remove Maintenance Orders, Notifications, Maintenance Plans, Task Lists, BOMs, Work Centres and Functional Location data from the system.
