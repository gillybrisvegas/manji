### Recent Projects
#### Enhancement Package Implementation
SAP Enhancement Packages have provided new opportunities to streamline your business processes. We helped our client assess and implement new functionality from the SAP Enhancement Packages.

#### Work Order and Warehouse Integration
Maintenance supervisors need to know if parts are on-site before commencing the job.  We improved warehouse business processes and enhanced SAP functionality. This provided visibility of material availability to the maintenance supervisors.

#### Support Package Project Management
SAP Support Packages are typically applied annually to ensure legal compliance and resolve SAP system defects.  We provided project management assistance to implement support packages into a SAP landscape containing ECC, BW, Portal, CRM and PI systems.

#### Archiving Plant Maintenance Data
Our client required plant maintenance data to be archived.  We worked with the client team to perform SAP archiving and remove Maintenance Orders, Notifications, Maintenance Plans, Task Lists, BOMs, Work Centres and Functional Location data from the system.
